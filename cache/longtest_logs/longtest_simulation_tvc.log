┌ Warning: No transitions observed in data (all statefrom == stateto). Falling back to :crude initialization. If this is template data for simulation, consider using `initialize=false` when creating the model.

┌ Warning: Model has no absorbing states. All states have at least one outgoing transition. This may cause simulation to run indefinitely or likelihood computation issues. Consider adding at least one absorbing state (a state with no outgoing transitions).
